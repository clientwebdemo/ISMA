      <h4>Five Social Media Tactics That Bring Results (And The Best Tools To Use)</h4>
      <br/>
      <img src="images/blog-3.jpg" alt="Blog Image">
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h4>1. Be Consistent Or Die</h4>
      <p>Launching your marketing efforts on social media is simple. It takes little to create a social media account and even less to populate it with content.</p>
      <p>But what happens next is more important. If you can’t sustain your presence by regularly posting content, then that social media account may as well be non–existent.</p>
      <p>Experts say consistent posting creates a huge impact on social media. For instance, consider the example of State Bicycle Company that increased its followers by about 100 times in three years by consistently posting engaging content.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h4>2. Post Only Content You’re Truly Proud Of</h4>
      <p>Have you optimized your business’s appearance on social media? Let’s look at some crucial elements of your social media presence: profile image, cover picture, and "about" descriptions.</p>
      <p>Each of those elements must:</p>
      <h3>Appear neat, clear, and professional</h3>
      <h3>Have the necessary information about your company and the products/services you offer</h3>
      <h3>Have a unique, visually appealing and likable identity</h3>
      <h3>Your social media content needs to connect with visitors. You can do that only by understanding your audience well.</h3>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h4>The most important requirement that a marketer needs to have is empathy.</h4>
      <p>Unless you can view things from the standpoint of your potential buyer, you won’t be well–positioned to design a content strategy that works.</p>
      <p>The single most important use for content is for a giveaway. You put together a piece that’s valuable to your audience and then give it away for free. The more generous you are, the better and more popular your piece will be.</p>
      <p>"It takes courage to give away something of value without expectation of immediate return," Jay Baer, business and social media strategist, has said. "The best content is content so useful that people would pay for it if you asked them to do so."</p>
      <p>Create content that helps your readers overcome a roadblock, learn a new skill, or improve the way they’re doing something, and they will thank you with their loyalty.</p>
      <p>To note: Your content must be unique. It could include an observation, inference, or understanding you have and choose to share with your social media followers. Share your experience with your followers, and show them that you can be trusted and relied upon.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h4>4. Amplify Your Social Media Reach with Your Personal and Professional Networks</h4>
      <p>You can easily increase your social reach by getting your colleagues, customers, and partners involved.</p>
      <p>The most influential sources of content on social media are friends and family. A Nielsen study found that "word-of-mouth formats, such as recommendations from family and friends and consumer opinions posted online, prompted the highest levels of action."</p>
      <p>One way to leverage this is by enabling your employees, partners, and happy customers to be active and advocate for you on social media. This can increase your reach and impact.</p>
      <p>About 80% of the businesses in this study claimed that employee presence on social media improved sales. Your employees already work with you on common goals, why not include them in your social media marketing efforts as well?</p>
      <p>This tactic is especially powerful for medium to large organizations with hundreds or thousands of employees. If each of them shares with their networks, not only do you reach their social connections, but you also gain a word-of-mouth recommendation.</p>
      <p>Swimwear brand BikiniLuxe, for example, implemented an employee advocacy program primarily to increase brand awareness. Right from recruitment, the brand insists on brand advocacy as an integral part of each employee’s job description.</p>
      <p>Simply by encouraging employees to post pictures wearing their products on social media and requesting them to get friends involved, the brand gained over 150,000 followers.</p>
      <p>Here’s an Instagram post by the photographer who shot pictures for the company and turned it into social media content. Note that she’s wearing the company’s product.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h4>5. Personal Engagement Trumps Mass Targeting</h4>
      <p>Content is generally written for many to read, creating a distance between the company and potential/current clients. While content is an important tactic, it shouldn’t be the only one you use. You need to extend your marketing to include networking on social media and one–on–one interaction.</p>
      <p>What are the "networking events" on social media?</p>
      <p>These could be Twitter chats, Blabs, Facebook and LinkedIn group discussions, interviews for social media posts, and comments right on your business page. You should ideally leverage all possible opportunities to network on social media.</p>
